            <p> Ghouls and Ghasts </p> –
            <p> It’s the most spooktacular time of the year, and for the fifth (we think) time in a row, the Halloween Horror Media Marathon of Madness (“H-hmmom”) is back! </p>

            <p> What is H-hmmom? Glad you asked! </p>

            <p> It is a frantic challenge celebrating the scary,  creepy, spooky and every other synonym for fright you may or may not know! Each day of October, the H-hmmom Creepmissioners will announce a media selection of the day – expect audio tapes, youtube videos, fright-trips to local spots, but mostly movies – and challenge participants to face their fears. </p>

            <p> Each curated selection will include a description and maybe a little extra information. Be warned when it comes to H-hmmom, nothing is true and anything is possible – so what you read may not be entirely factual. </p>

            <p> The daily H-hmmomery will be announced (hopefully) by 5pm.  </p>
